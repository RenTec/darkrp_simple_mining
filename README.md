Spawn the rocks anywhere you want from the simple mining tab under entities
Spawned rock models are randomized when spawning from the spawn menu
Use console commands sv_save and sv_load to save your mining rock positions
Use console command sm_delete_all to delete all of the spawned mining rocks AND delete the saved JSON data

Rocks will autospawn on map load, change and cleanup
